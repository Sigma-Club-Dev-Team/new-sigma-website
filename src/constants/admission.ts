  "The Purple Tie Beckons.\n\n" +
  "Sigma Club, the University of Ibadan’s premier socio-philanthropic student organization, once again opens its gates to men who dare to be more than ordinary. " +
  "The Sigma Admission Interview is upon us. This moment is not merely an academic or social milestone — it is a solemn invitation into a legacy. " +
  "A legacy of purpose-driven service, intellectual distinction, and uncompromising virtue. The Purple Tie does not call to all — it calls to the few who dare to rise above the ordinary.\n\n" +

  "An Enduring Legacy\n" +
  "Since its founding in 1950, Sigma Club has stood as the vanguard of gentlemanly ideals and selfless service within the University of Ibadan and beyond. " +
  "Its creed — For all that is pure — remains a living standard for every Sigmite who bears the mantle. " +
  "Through decades of transformation, Sigma has remained unwavering in its mission: to mould principled men of substance, and to serve as a crucible for future leaders across generations. " +
  "From Loyal Sigmites to Honorary Sigmites — the history of Sigma Club is inscribed in the lives of men who shaped nations, institutions, and communities. " +
  "These are men whose lives exemplify the Club’s values of character, class, and courage.\n\n" +

  "The Admission Interview: More Than a Process\n" +
  "The Sigma Admission Interview is not a mere selection procedure. It is a rite of passage into a timeless brotherhood — one defined not by titles, wealth, or fleeting status, " +
  "but by an enduring commitment to honour, excellence, and service. It is a deliberate, discerning process designed to identify those who reflect the Club’s ideals — " +
  "men of thought, men of principle, and men of quiet strength. Men who speak not only with words but with action. Men ready to contribute to something greater than themselves.\n\n" +

  "Eligibility Criteria\n" +
  "To preserve the integrity and continuity of Sigma Club, the following eligibility criteria apply:\n" +
  "• Male undergraduate students of the University of Ibadan are eligible.\n" +
  "• Penultimate and final year students are not eligible.\n" +
  "The Club seeks young men with time to grow within its ranks — individuals who can be nurtured, challenged, and refined into future custodians of its heritage.\n\n" +

  "An Invitation to Purpose\n" +
  "This is not a call for popularity. It is not an appeal to vanity. This is an invitation to purpose. A challenge to stand apart from the crowd — not in pride, but in principle. " +
  "To wear the Purple Tie is to carry the weight of a tradition that spans decades. It is to commit oneself to philanthropy, leadership, intellectual growth, and above all, purity of intent. " +
  "If you feel the stir of something noble within — if you sense the call to rise with integrity and serve with honour — then the moment is now.\n\n" +
